    <h3>Expedia Office Locations</h3>

    <p>Expedia Group has its headquarters on Elliott Bay in Seattle.</p>

    <p>On April 2, 2015, Expedia announced that it would move its headquarters to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle by the end of 2018, purchasing the Amgen campus on the Elliott Bay waterfront for $228.9 million.[49] As part of the move, Expedia is proposing an expansion of office space at the 41-acre (17 ha) campus to 1.23 million square feet (114,000 m2) to accommodate employees, designed by ZGF Architects</p>

    <div class="addition">
      <h2>In addition to the campus, Expedia gained ownership of the Helix bridge, now named Expedia Group Bridge, and a plot of land now used as a transportation hub for Expedia employees</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The move was later delayed to 2019, citing some logistical hurdles including the commute from the Eastside to Seattle as well as traffic congestion near the campus.[52] Incentives for employees to seek alternative forms of transportation were also announced, with the company exploring company shuttle services from park and rides in Redmond.</p>
